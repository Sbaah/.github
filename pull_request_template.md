Submitting a pull request
-------------------------

First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project :sparkles:!
Every contribution means a lot to us.

Please make sure you check everything on this list:

- add your change to the `CHANGELOG.md` in the respective repository
- make sure tests pass :white_check_mark:
- if your commit does close an existing ticket: use a [closing issue keyword](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords) (e.g: `closes #15`) in your commit. This makes live easier for our issue tracker.
- if possible, test your changes with the deploy preview at least once. Promises made, you will enjoy it :hamburger:
