Checklist for issue reports
---------------------------

If you open an issue in one of our issue trackers, please include a decent amount of information to reproduce. It may not have been outlined enough, but [writing good bug reports](https://www.softwaretestinghelp.com/how-to-write-good-bug-report/) is an art in itself. 

Please include at least the following information:

- the version that is affected. If you use the deployed version of `site` or `dashboard`, you can assume the latest `master`
- a textual description of what is the problem
- a copy of your requests to `api.eventzimmer.de`. Include at least the `request headers`, `response headers` and `body`. In Chrome, you can easily capture requests with [network analysis](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network/reference) from the devtools.
- optionally a visual description of your issue. It **really** helps if you record a video, or a GIF of your bug. 

If you do include a request `body`, consider uploading it as a file attachment to your issue. Noone wants to read network dumps in a GitHub issue. Thanks :wine_glass:
