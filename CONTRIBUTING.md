Contribution guideline
----------------------

Heads up! You've already made the first step by reading through the repository that led you here. We'd like you to add some finishing touches for your contributions :sparkles: 

### Self-conception

`eventzimmer` is a non-profit organization which comes with a privacy first mentality. It was born out of the idea that noone should have to log in, let alone provide personal information, to access public information (erm, erm, Facebook). If you make a contribution, please bear this in mind. New features should invade user privacy as little as possible. Thank you :cake: 

### Submitting your pull requests

We highly value the open source community. It is insanely innovative, and unlike professional environment, leaves plenty of room for experiments.

Noone grows a guru, so do not be afraid of submitting even a rough idea. We will guide you through the process, if need be.

All of our repositories come with continous integration and continous deployment. If your PR is green :white_check_mark:  on GitHub, it will most likely pass.

### Side notes about licensing

If you submit a pull request in one of our repositories, please do note you understand the consequences. Unless explicitely stated otherwise, your source code **will** be published with the repositories license (MIT). Contributions with incompatible license will most likely not be accepted.
